Write python code for a simple game
#This code represents a basic guessing game game
#involving interaction between the user and the computer.

import random  # This imports the random module

print('Welcome to my guessing game!')

# This generates a random number to start the game. 
secret_number = random.randint(1, 10)

# This for loop will run 10 times and allow the user 10 chances to guess the number. 
for guess_
