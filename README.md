# Open A.I. Chatbot
This is a chatbot developed using Python and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture. The chatbot is designed to remember conversations with the user and learn from them, allowing for more personalized and natural interactions.

## Installation
To use the chatbot, first, clone the repository onto your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisjnielson44/AI-Chatbot
```
Next, install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```
Finally, create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key (I provided an example in /Python-AIChatbot):
```bash
YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
YOUR_DESIRED_MAX_TOKEN_AMOUNT=YOUR_DESIRED_MAX_TOKEN_AMOUNT
YOUR_DESIRED_TEMP=YOUR_DESIRED_TEMP
NUMBER_OF_COMPLETIONS=NUMBER_OF_COMPLETIONS
```
